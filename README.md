# Project 1 - MyStory App

Submitted by: Samyak Jain

The "MyStory App" is an app inspired by Monkey D. Luffy, an animated character from the show "One Piece." This app allows users to explore Luffy's world and learn about his adventures through three context items. Users can tap into each item to view detailed information such as the title, description, and picture. The app's interface is customized with a unique app icon and launch screen, and it's designed to work seamlessly on any screen size and orientation using AutoLayout constraints. Additionally, the user interface is improved and personalized through styling and coloring. Overall, the "MyStory App" is an engaging and interactive way for One Piece fans to immerse themselves in Luffy's world.
